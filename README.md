# Mapty Project

This is an advanced project that was focused on using OOP, Geolocation, and introduced the basics of project planning for large projects. It was done through the course "Complete Javascript Course 2025" by Jonas Schmedtmann. It can be accessed [here](mapty-david-project.netlify.app).
Further features were added separately from the course version to allow for workout editing and deletion of workouts. 

How to use: 
- Allow location to allow map to load
- click on any area of the map to log workout location
- You can switch the type of workout between cycling and walking/running
